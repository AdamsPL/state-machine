# State machine blog post code repository

## Introduction
This repository contains code referenced in state-machine themed series of blog posts under sii.pl/blog/.

## Basics
All the examples can be easily compiled by using provided shell scripts:
```bash
./scripts/init.sh #to initialize the default build dir
./scripts/builds.sh #to build both clang and gcc versions of examples
```

## Future
I'm planning to create a standalone repository with a header-only state machine library based on the code in this repo in the near future
